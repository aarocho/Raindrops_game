Raindrops_game
==============

This is a game where you catch raindrops.

In this game, the player will strive to catch all of the raindrops that fall from the top of the screen. If more than three lives have been used, then an image of grumpy cat will appear telling the player that they have gotten water on grumpy cat and that the game is over.

Features include:
*A catcher in the shape of a circle.
*Raindrops that are also in the shape of circles with trails following them.
*An adorable image of a cat looking out the window at the rain as the background.
*A power up that appears three times throughout the course of the game.
*** this boost will cause the catcher to double in size, therefore catching more raindrops. BUT: The raindrop that contains this boost will be much smaller than the other raindrops, and also a different color(most likely will be black or a darker blue to make it hard to see).
